# Chrome Tabs to List

Copies all of the current window's open tabs to the clipboard as an html unordered list of links.

This script is intended for use when I'm teaching and want to quickly put resources that have been reviewed into a CMS at the end of class.

## Options

Enter chrome://extensions into the URL bar to get to see and set extension options. Options can modify...

* The type of list (ordered or unordered)
* The format of each list item (url only, tab title only, both)
* The format of the clipboard data (text/plain or text/html)
